# Admin Guide

## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for developers and system administrators who want to harden/configure Swirl Metasearch for production use.

# Installation

## Configuring the Swirl Environment

New in version 1.8, Swirl uses `django-environ` to load important values such as hostname from a file called `.env`.

The file `.env.dist` contains expected defaults. If no `.env` file is created, then the `install.sh` script copy this file to `.env` prior to startup.

``` shell
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost
PROTOCOL=http
SWIRL_EXPLAIN=True
SQL_ENGINE=django.db.backends.sqlite3
SQL_DATABASE=db.sqlite3
SQL_USER=user
SQL_PASSWORD=password
SQL_HOST=localhost
SQL_PORT=5432
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=''
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=''
MICROSOFT_REDIRECT_URI=''
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

To configure a Swirl server to listen on a particular port, hostname, via HTTPS, etc., modify the `.env` file and then restart Swirl. There should never be a `.env` file in the Swirl repo, and when updating Swirl to a new version, no migration of these settings should be needed. They remain in `.env`.

The `SWIRL_EXPLAIN` item determines if Swirl will show the [explain structure](5.-Developer-Guide.md#understand-the-explain-structure) or not.

The `SECRET_KEY` is actually a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) used by Django. Swirl recommends [generating a new one](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/signing/) for production use.

## Creating a Swirl Super User

To start over with a new database, delete or rename the `db.sqlite3` file. Then run this command:

``` shell
python swirl.py setup
```

This will create a new, blank database. To create a Super User, run the following command:

``` shell
python manage.py createsuperuser --email admin@example.com --username admin
```

## Changing a Super User Password

If you already have an `admin` user, you can change the password with this command:

``` shell
python manage.py changepassword admin
```

If you select a password that is too simple, Django will object. 
For more information see: [django-admin and manage.py](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/django-admin/)

## Adding Normal Users

Use the Django Admin UI to add users:

```
http://localhost:8000/admin/
```

![Django Admin - Users](images/django_admin_console_user.png)

## Permissioning Normal Users

There are four permissions -- `add`, `change`, `delete`, and `view` -- for each of the core Swirl objects: `SearchProviders`, `Search`, `Result`, and `Query Transform`.

![Django Admin - Permissions](images/django_admin_console_permissions.png)

<br/>

The following table shows how to configure these for various scenarios:

| Scenario | SearchProvider | Search | Results | Query Transform |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Admin       | ALL            | ALL    | ALL     | ALL |
| Search ONLY | NONE           | Add    |         |     | 
| Result ONLY | NONE           | NONE   | View    |     | 
| Search & View Results | NONE | Add, View | Add, View | Add, View |
| Manage Search including re-run | NONE | ALL | ALL | ALL |
| SearchProvider Admin | ALL | Add | View | View |

## Object Ownership

SearchProvider, Search, Result, and Query Transform objects are owned by, and private to, the Django user who creates them.

## Shared SearchProviders and Query Transformations

Swirl supports shared SearchProviders (v. 1.7) and Query Transformations (v. 2.0). These defaults to "false" for all Users, except the Django Super User (`admin`) which defaults to "true". This makes it easy to add users without having to duplicate SearchProviders or Query Transformations. 
  
For installations with a large number of users, create groups with the desired permissions first, then assign each User to the appropriate group.

# Deploying Swirl for Production Use

The Swirl application is designed to be deployed behind a reverse-proxy. There are many reasons for this:

* Scalability: a reverse-proxy allows for the horizontal scaling of Swirl. By deploying multiple Swirl application VMs behind a reverse-proxy, the incoming connection demands can be handled by the reverse-proxy then disseminated to a pool of backend Swirl servers. If demand for Swirl increases, additional VMs can be provisioned on-demand. These VMs can also be turned down when the traffic drops below certain thresholds to save on hosting costs.

* Security: Offloading the SSL/TLS overhead to a dedicated public endpoint such as a reverse-proxy alleviates the CPU load on the application server that serves up Swirl.

* Performance: Using a reverse-proxy separates the task of serving up static content from the application server. This makes it possible to deploy Swirl with a content delivery network (CDN) which places static content close to the end user for a faster Swirl experience.

* Availability: a reverse-proxy adds resiliency to any setup by spreading traffic across a backend pool of Swirl servers. The reverse-proxy monitors the pool of available backend servers and detects and removes failed servers from a pool of available ones.

Popular reverse-proxy projects/products include [HA Proxy](https://www.haproxy.org/), [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/), [Azure Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/application-gateway) and [AWS Application Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/application-load-balancer/).

# Hardware Sizing

As of Swirl 2.5, the federation process is CPU-bound. To maximize core utilization, allocate four (4) times the number of Celery workers. 

Swirl can be run continuously with minimal latency so long as:

```
(num_searches * num_searchproviders) <= num_cores
```

[Contact support](#support) to discuss this topic anytime.

# Upgrading Swirl

{: .warning }
Please [contact support](#support) for instructions on upgrading Docker containers!

1. Update the `swirl-search` repository:
``` shell
git pull
```

2. Run the install script:
``` shell
./install.sh
```

3. Setup Swirl:
``` shell
python swirl.py setup
```

4. Restart Swirl core, if running:
``` shell
python swirl.py restart core
```

# Configuring Swirl

New in Swirl 1.8: `SWIRL_EXPLAIN` is now configured as an environment variable.

Swirl uses the following configuration items, defined in the [`swirl_server/settings.py`](https://github.com/swirlai/swirl-search/blob/main/swirl_server/settings.py):

| Configuration Item | Explanation | Example |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| CELERY_BEATS_SCHEDULE | Defines the schedule for the [Search Expiration Service](#search-expiration-service) and [Search Subscriber Service](#search-subscriber-service) | See the linked sections. |
| SWIRL_DEFAULT_QUERY_LANGUAGE | Determines which stopword dictionary is loaded | `SWIRL_DEFAULT_QUERY_LANGUAGE = 'english'` | 
| SWIRL_TIMEOUT | The number of seconds to wait until declaring federation complete, and terminating any connectors that haven't responded | `SWIRL_TIMEOUT = 10` |
| SWIRL_Q_WAIT | The number of seconds to wait before redirecting to the Result Mixer after using the [q= parameter](5.-Developer-Guide.md#create-a-search-object-with-the-q-url-parameter) | `SWIRL_Q_WAIT = 7` |
| SWIRL_RERUN_WAIT | The number of seconds to wait before redirecting to the Result Mixer when [re-running a search](5.-Developer-Guide.md#re-run-a-search) | `SWIRL_RERUN_WAIT = 8` |
| SWIRL_SUBSCRIBE_WAIT | The number of seconds to wait before timing out and reporting an error when [updating a search](5.-Developer-Guide.md#update-a-search) | `SWIRL_SUBSCRIBE_WAIT = 20` |
| SWIRL_DEDUPE_FIELD | The field to use when [detecting and removing duplicates](5.-Developer-Guide.md#detect-and-remove-duplicate-results) with the `DedupeByFieldPostResultProcessor` | `SWIRL_DEDUPE_FIELD = 'url'` |
| SWIRL_DEDUPE_SIMILARITY_MINIMUM | The minimum similarity score that constitutes a duplicate, when [detecting and removing duplicates](5.-Developer-Guide.md#detect-and-remove-duplicate-results) with the `DedupeBySimilarityPostResultProcessor` | `SWIRL_DEDUPE_SIMILARITY_MINIMUM = 0.95` |
| SWIRL_DEDUPE_SIMILARITY_FIELDS | A list of the fields to use when determining the similarity between documents when [detecting and removing duplicates](5.-Developer-Guide.md#detect-and-remove-duplicate-results) with the `DedupeBySimilarityPostResultProcessor` | `SWIRL_DEDUPE_SIMILARITY_FIELDS = ['title', 'body']` | 
| SWIRL_RELEVANCY_CONFIG | Defines the relevancy score weights for important fields | See below |
| SWIRL_MAX_MATCHES | Configures the maximum number of matches for any given result, before being cut-off. This helps protect against favoring very long articles. | `SWIRL_MAX_MATCHES = 5` |
| SWIRL_MIN_SIMILARITY | Configures the minimum threshold at which a query hit in a result will be scored. Lower values will increase recall but lower precision. | `SWIRL_MIN_SIMILARITY = 0.54` |

### Example SWIRL_RELEVANCY_CONFIG

``` shell
SWIRL_RELEVANCY_CONFIG = {
    'title': {
        'weight': 1.5
    },
    'body': {
        'weight': 1.0
    },
    'author': {
        'weight': 1.0
    }
}
``` 

Note that all configuration names must be UPPER_CASE per the [django settings convention](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/settings/).

# Search Expiration Service

The [Expirer](https://github.com/swirlai/swirl-search/blob/main/swirl/expirer.py) service can automatically delete Search and their associated (linked) Result objects after a specified period of time - to ensure Swirl doesn't retain everything ever searched. 

By default, this service runs every hour. The frequency is defined in the [Django settings](https://github.com/swirlai/swirl-search/blob/main/swirl_server/settings.py):

``` shell
CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE = {
    # Executes every hour
    'expire': { 
         'task': 'expirer', 
         'schedule': crontab(minute=0,hour='*'),
        },          
}
```

Temporary changes can also be made via the Django Console here:

```
http://localhost:8000/admin/django_celery_beat/crontabschedule/ 
```
![Django console crontab page](images/django_admin_console_crontab.png)

{: .warning }
If you change the `crontab` entry in the database and don't change the `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` as well, that schedule will be restored if/when you restart Swirl.

# Search Subscriber Service

When one or more Search objects [have the subscribe property set to True](5.-Developer-Guide.md#subscribe-to-a-search), Swirl will periodically [update that Search](5.-Developer-Guide.md#update-a-search).

By default, the Subscriber service runs every four hours. The frequency is defined in the [Django settings](https://github.com/swirlai/swirl-search/blob/main/swirl_server/settings.py):

``` shell
CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE = {
    # Executes every four hours
    'subscribe': { 
         'task': 'subscriber', 
         'schedule': crontab(minute=0,hour='*/4'),   # minute='*/10'
        },          
}
```

Temporary changes can also be made via the Django Console here:

```
http://localhost:8000/admin/django_celery_beat/crontabschedule/
```

![Django console crontab page](images/django_admin_console_crontab.png)

{: .warning }
If you change the `crontab` entry in the database and don't change the `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` as well, that schedule will be restored if/when you restart Swirl.

# Service Startup & Daemonization

## Using `swirl.py`

For normal operations, use `swirl.py` to start, stop or restart services. It is located in Swirl's install directory (along with `manage.py`).

{: .warning }
Swirl's control scripts were updated in version 2.5!

* A `default` key was added to the services list, including `debug`, in `swirl/services.py`
* The `celery-beats` service was set to `default: False`
* swirl.py was modified to load only services with default: True

To use the subscribe or expiration features, `celery-beats` must be started (and stopped) separately:

``` shell
python swirl.py start celery-beats
```

* To start services:

``` shell
python swirl.py start
```

One or more services may be specified, e.g.:

``` shell
python swirl.py start celery-beats
```

* To check the status of Swirl:

``` shell
python swirl.py status
```

Swirl will report the current running services, and their pids:

``` shell
__S_W_I_R_L__2_._6______________________________________________________________

Service: django...RUNNING, pid:1620
Service: celery-worker...RUNNING, pid:1625

  PID TTY           TIME CMD
 1620 ttys000    0:13.26 /Users/erikspears/.pyenv/versions/3.11.5/bin/python3.11 /Users/erikspears/.pyenv/versions/3.11.5/bin/daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 swirl_server.asgi:application
 1625 ttys000    0:40.70 /Users/erikspears/.pyenv/versions/3.11.5/bin/python3.11 /Users/erikspears/.pyenv/versions/3.11.5/bin/celery -A swirl_server worker --loglevel INFO

Command successful!
```

* To terminate services:

``` shell
python swirl.py stop
```

* To restart services:

``` shell
python swirl.py restart
```

One or more services may be specified, e.g.:

``` shell
python swirl.py restart celery-worker consumer
```

* To get help:

``` shell
python swirl.py help
```

* To run in DEBUG mode:

``` shell
python swirl.py --debug start
```

This will switch from running Daphne to the built-in Django webserver (`runserver`) and will set the logging level to DEBUG.

## Customizing

The services invoked by `swirl.py` are defined in [swirl/services.py](https://github.com/swirlai/swirl-search/blob/main/swirl/services.py). See the previous section for changes to the services definitions in version 2.5.

## Troubleshooting

Note that `swirl.py` writes the list of services and their associated pids to a file: `.swirl`

Here is an example of a `.swirl` file for a fully running system:

``` shell
{"redis": 26365, "django": 26391, "celery-worker": 26424}
```

This file is read by the `status` and `stop` commands. Both commands invoke `ps -p` with the pids for the services to determine if they are actually running and display this information for you.

If you `start` or `stop` individual services, the `.swirl` file should only have the names and pids for running services. 

In the event that the `.swirl` file is out of sync with the running processes, you may delete it, or edit it to match the
actual running processes. Be sure to manually delete any running processes. You can find them as follows:

On OS/X or Linux:

``` shell
ps -ef | grep python
ps -ef | grep celery
ps -ef | grep redis
```

* When troubleshooting `swirl.py` be sure to look at `logs/*.log`. Live services will continue writing to the appropriately
named logfile.

* If a service starts and then isn't running a short time later, check the log files as there is likely an exception occurring.

* To change startup incantations, services names, or default value for any service, edit the `SWIRL_SERVICES` variable in `swirl/services.py`:

``` shell
SWIRL_SERVICES = [
    {
        'name': 'redis',
        'path': 'retired : redis-server ./redis.conf',
        'default': False,
        'retired': True
    },
    {
        'name': 'django',
        'path': 'daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 swirl_server.asgi:application',
        'default': True,
        'retired': False
    },
    {
        'name': 'celery-worker',
        'path': 'celery -A swirl_server worker --loglevel INFO',
        'default': True,
        'retired': False
    },
    {
        'name': 'celery-beats',
        'path': 'celery -A swirl_server beat --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler',
        'default': False,
        'retired': False
    }
]
```

Note that `swirl.py` starts the services in the order specified, but terminates the first service last - with a longer delay and using a group signal to shut down.

# Manually Starting Services

The exact incantations to start the services varies by Operating System. The following sections present them along with the expected output.

## Mac OS/X or Linux

Run each command shown below in a separate terminal window, in the directory where you installed Swirl, e.g. `swirl-search`, in the order specified below.

*Don't* run these commands in the `swirl_server` subdirectory!  They won't work there. If you aren't sure, check that `manage.py` is present in your current directory.

{: .warning }
As of Release 2.6, Swirl's start-up process no longer starts `redis`. You must now have `redis` installed and running before starting Swirl.

1. Setup Django
```  shell
cd swirl-search
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py makemigrations swirl
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic
```

2. Start Django Server
``` shell
cd swirl-search
daphne swirl_server.asgi:application
```
When Django is running [the front page should load...](http://localhost:8000/swirl/)
<br/>
![Swirl Front Page](images/swirl_frontpage.png)

3. Start Celery Worker
``` shell
cd swirl-search
celery -A swirl_server worker --loglevel=info 
```

4. Start Celery Beats 
This is only required if using the [Search Expiration Service](#search-expiration-service) or the [Search Subscription Service](#search-subscriber-service).
``` shell
celery -A swirl_server beat -l INFO --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
```

# Managing Django Users

## Django Admin

Most users can be managed through the Django Admin, which is located here:

```
http://localhost:8000/admin/
```

## To Change a User's Password

``` shell
python manage.py changepassword <user_name>
```

# Management Tools

## Django Console

Django has a built-in web UI for managing users, groups, crontabs, and more. 

![Django console ](images/django_admin_console.png)

The URL is: [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/) 

## Django dbshell

Django has a built-in shell for managing the database. You can run it in the `swirl-search` directory as follows:

``` shell
./manage.py dbshell
```

## Wiping the Database

``` shell
python manage.py flush
```

All Swirl objects will be deleted, once you confirm.

{: .warning }
You must create a new [Swirl Super User](#creating-a-swirl-super-user) after doing this. 

## `sqlite-web`

The open source `sqlite-web` project offers a solid web GUI!
 
``` shell
pip install sqlite-web
sqlite_web my_database.db                   # makes it run locally http://localhost:8080/
sqlite_web --host 0.0.0.0 my_database.db    # run it on the lan
```

Don't forget to give it the path to `db.sqlite3` in `swirl-search` when you invoke it.

# Database Migration

If you change most anything in `swirl/models.py`, you will have to perform a database migration. Detailing this process is beyond the scope of this document. For the most part, all you have to do is:

``` shell
python swirl.py migrate
```

For more information: [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/migrations/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/migrations/)

* Migration is usually simple/easy if you are just adding fields or changing defaults 
* It's a good idea to delete existing data before doing anything drastic like changing the name of an `id` or relationship - use `sqlite-web` (see above)!
* If things go wrong:
    * Delete `db.sqlite3`
    * Delete all `swirl/migrations/`
    * Run: `python manage.py flush`
    * Then, repeat this process

{: .warning }
Don't forget to [create a Swirl Super User](#creating-a-swirl-super-user) after flushing the database!

# Configuring Django

There are many values you can configure in [`swirl_server/settings.py`](https://github.com/swirlai/swirl-search/blob/main/swirl_server/settings.py). 

These include:
* Hostname
* Protocol

``` shell
# PUT the FQDN first in the list below
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost']
HOSTNAME = ALLOWED_HOSTS[0]
PROTOCOL = 'http'
```

{: .highlight }
The FQDN that Swirl should listen on must be the first entry in the `ALLOWED_HOST` list.

* Time Zone

``` shell
TIME_ZONE = 'US/Eastern'
...
CELERY_TIMEZONE = "US/Eastern"
CELERY_TIME_ZONE = "US/Eastern"
```

* Celery Beats

The configuration for Celery-Beats is also here, in case you are using the [Search Expiration Service](#search-expiration-service) or the [Search Subscription Service](#search-subscriber-service):

``` shell
CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE = {
    # Executes every hour
    'expire': { 
         'task': 'expirer', 
         'schedule': crontab(minute=0,hour='*'),
        },          
}
```

* Database Provider

``` shell
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": os.environ.get("SQL_ENGINE", "django.db.backends.sqlite3"),
        "NAME": os.environ.get("SQL_DATABASE", BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3"),
        "USER": os.environ.get("SQL_USER", "user"),
        "PASSWORD": os.environ.get("SQL_PASSWORD", "password"),
        "HOST": os.environ.get("SQL_HOST", "localhost"),
        "PORT": os.environ.get("SQL_PORT", "5432"),
    }
}
```

To configure PostgreSQL as the Django back-end:

1. Install PostgreSQL (if not already installed)
2. Ensure that `pg_config` from the PostgreSQL distribution is in the `PATH` and runs from the command line
3. Install the `psycopg2` driver:
``` shell
pip install psycopg2
```
Then follow the appropriate section of [Configuring Django Database Back-Ends](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/databases/).

4. Uncomment the PostgreSQL Connector in the following modules:
* [`swirl.connectors.__init__.py`](https://github.com/swirlai/swirl-search/blob/main/swirl/connectors/__init__.py)
``` shell
# uncomment this to enable PostgreSQL
# from swirl.connectors.postgresql import PostgreSQL
```
* [`swirl.models.py`](https://github.com/swirlai/swirl-search/blob/main/swirl/models.py)
``` shell
CONNECTOR_CHOICES = [
    ('ChatGPT', 'ChatGPT Query String'),
    ('RequestsGet', 'HTTP/GET returning JSON'),
    ('RequestsPost', 'HTTP/POST returning JSON'),
    ('Elastic', 'Elasticsearch Query String'),
    ('OpenSearch', 'OpenSearch Query String'),
    # Uncomment the line below to enable PostgreSQL
    # ('PostgreSQL', 'PostgreSQL'),
    ('BigQuery', 'Google BigQuery'),
    ('Sqlite3', 'Sqlite3'),
    ('M365OutlookMessages', 'M365 Outlook Messages'),
    ('M365OneDrive', 'M365 One Drive'),
    ('M365OutlookCalendar', 'M365 Outlook Calendar'),
    ('M365SharePointSites', 'M365 SharePoint Sites'),
    ('MicrosoftTeams', 'Microsoft Teams'),
]
```

# Configuring Celery & Redis

Celery is used to execute a Swirl federated search. It uses Redis as a result back-end for asynchronous operation. Both of these systems must be configured correctly.

{: .warning }
Celery is configured in at least three locations. They must be the same! 

1. [`swirl_server/celery.py`](https://github.com/swirlai/swirl-search/blob/main/swirl_server/celery.py)
``` shell
app = Celery('swirl_server', 
             broker='redis://localhost:6379/0', 
             backend='redis://localhost:6379/0')
```
If this is setup correctly, you should see the backend setting appear when you run Celery from the command line:
``` shell
> transport:   amqp://guest:**@localhost:6379//
- ** ---------- .> results:     rpc://
```

2. [`swirl_server/settings.py`](https://github.com/swirlai/swirl-search/blob/main/swirl_server/settings.py) (Django settings):

``` shell
# Celery Configuration Options
CELERY_TIMEZONE = 'US/Eastern'
CELERY_TIME_ZONE = 'US/Eastern'
CELERY_TASK_TRACK_STARTED = True
CELERY_TASK_TIME_LIMIT = 30 * 60
CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE = {
    # Executes every hour
    'expire': {
         'task': 'expirer',
         'schedule': crontab(minute=0,hour='*'),
        },
    # Executes every four hours
    'subscribe': {
         'task': 'subscriber',
         'schedule': crontab(minute=0,hour='*/4'),   # minute='*/10'
        },
}
CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
# CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'amqp://guest:guest@localhost:6379//'

CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
# CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND='rpc://'
```

The `settings.py` file also contains the configuration for the [Search Expiration Service](#search-expiration-service) and the [Search Subscription Service](#search-subscriber-service).

# Security

## The Django Secret Key

In `swirl_server/settings.py`, there is a configuration item for a `SECRET_KEY`. This is not really a big deal. If you change it, active users will have to login again. That's it.

To change the one that is in the repo:

``` shell
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe())"
```

## Swirl User & Group Support

You can use Django's built-in authentication support, which adds User and Group objects, or implement your own. The following sections detail how to access these.

| URL | Explanation |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| /swirl/users/      | List User objects; create a new one using the form at bottom |
| /swirl/users/id/ | Retrieve a User object; destroy it using the Delete button; edit it using the form at bottom  |

| URL | Explanation |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| /swirl/groups/      | List Group objects; create a new one using the form at bottom |
| /swirl/groups/id/ | Retrieve a Group object; destroy it using the Delete button; edit it using the form at bottom  |

You can also edit these tables using the [Django Console](#django-console):

![Django console user object](images/django_admin_console_user.png)

For more information, see: [User authentication in Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/auth/)

# Troubleshooting

## Log Information

All Swirl services write log files in the `logs/` folder under `swirl-search`. 

Here's what to expect in each:

| Logfile | Details | Notes | 
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| logs/redis.log | Contains infrastructure issues for the in-memory data store | Not involved in federation |
| logs/django.log | Contains the log of the Django container, which includes all HTTP activity API calls. | Not involved in federation |
| logs/celery-worker.log | Contains the log of Celery tasks | Very involved in federation, look for detailed information regarding errors in `search.status` or partial results |
| logs/celery-beats.log | Contains the log of the celery-beats service, which is only used by the Search Expiration and Subscription Services | Look here for issues with subscription or expiration not working | 

From the Swirl root directory, try running:

``` shell
python swirl.py logs/
```

This will show you the collected, latest output of all logs, continuously.

As of version 2.5, Swirl now outputs a single log entry with each request at the default log level INFO:

``` shell
2023-08-02 10:49:09,466 INFO     admin search 452 FULL_RESULTS_READY 32 2.2
```

Detailed logging is available in Debug mode: restart Swirl with the `--debug` flag to enable (or edit the `settings.py` file as outlined below).

## Debug Mode

By default, Swirl ships in production mode. To put Django into DEBUG mode, modify [`swirl_server/settings.py`](https://github.com/swirlai/swirl-search/blob/main/swirl_server/settings.py), changing:

``` shell
DEBUG = False
```

...to...

``` shell
DEBUG = True
```

Then restart Django.  Debug mode provides far more debugging information.

You can also configure the logger invoked at the top of each module. For example, to turn logging up to DEBUG, add the following
incantation after the line 'import logging as logger':

``` shell
logger.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
