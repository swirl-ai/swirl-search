Swirl is open source software that simultaneously searches multiple content sources and returns AI ranked results. Prompt your choice of Generative AI using the top N results to get answers incorporating your own data.

Swirl can connect to:

* Databases (SQL & NoSQL, Google BigQuery)
* Public data services (Google Programmable Search, Arxiv.org, etc.)
* Enterprise sources (Microsoft 365, Jira, Miro etc.)

And generate insights with AI and LLMs like ChatGPT. Start discovering and generating the answers you need based on your data.

Swirl is as simple as ABC: (a) Download YML, (b) Start in Docker, (c) Search with Swirl. From there, add credentials to preloaded SearchProviders to get results from more sources.

# 🔎 How Swirl Works

Swirl adapts and distributes user queries to anything with a search API - search engines, databases, noSQL engines, cloud/SaaS services, data siloes, etc. And uses Large Language Models to re-rank the unified results *without* extracting or indexing *anything*.

# 🔥 Try Swirl Now In Docker

## Prerequisites

* To run Swirl in Docker, you must have the latest [Docker app](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for MacOS, Linux, or Windows installed and running locally.

* Windows users must also install and configure either the WSL 2 or the Hyper-V backend, as outlined in the  [System Requirements for installing Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/#system-requirements).

## Start Swirl in Docker

> **Warning** 
> Make sure the Docker app is running before proceeding!

* Download [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swirlai/swirl-search/main/docker-compose.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swirlai/swirl-search/main/docker-compose.yaml)

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swirlai/swirl-search/main/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml
```

* In MacOS or Linux, run the following command from the Console:

```
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
```

* In Windows, run the following command from PowerShell:

```
docker compose up
```

After a few minutes the following or similar should appear:

<img src="https://github.com/swirlai/swirl-search/wiki/images/swirl_docker_1.png" height="70%" width="90%">

* Open this URL with a browser: <http://localhost:8000> (or <http://localhost:8000/galaxy>)

* If the search page appears, click `Log Out` at the top, right. The Swirl login page will appear.

* Enter the username `admin` and password `password`, then click `Login`.

<img src="https://github.com/swirlai/swirl-search/wiki/images/galaxy_ui_2.png" height="70%" weight="70%">

* To view the raw JSON, open <http://localhost:8000/swirl/search/>

The most recent Search object will be displayed at the top. Click on the `result_url` link to view the full JSON Response.

## Notes 📝

> **Warning**

:key: Swirl includes four (4) Google Programmable Search Engines (PSEs) to get you up and running right away. The credentials for these are shared with the Swirl Community.

:key: Using Swirl with Microsoft 365 requires installation and approval by an authorized company Administrator. For more information, please review the [M365 Guide](4.-M365-Guide) or [contact us](mailto:hello@swirl.today).
